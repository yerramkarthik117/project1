<h2>Jaundice fever</h2>
    *Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels.
    *It is commonly associated with itchiness.[1] The feces may be pale and the urine dark.
    *Jaundice in babies occurs in over half in the first week following birth and in most is not a problem.
    *If bilirubin levels in babies are very high for too long, a type of brain damage, known as kernicterus, may occur.

  There are two main types of Typhi namely the ST1 and ST2 based on MLST subtyping scheme, which are currently widespread globally.
       
<h2> Risk Factors</h2>
   Underlying conditions that may cause jaundice include:

<h3>Acute inflammation of the liver</h3>: This may impair the ability of the liver to conjugate and secrete bilirubin, resulting in a buildup.
<h3>Inflammation of the bile duct</h3>: This can prevent the secretion of bile and removal of bilirubin, causing jaundice.
<h3>Obstruction of the bile duct</h3>: This prevents the liver from disposing of bilirubin.
<h3>Hemolytic anemia</h3>: The production of bilirubin increases when large quantities of red blood cells are broken down.
<h3>Gilbert's syndrome</h3>: This is an inherited condition that impairs the ability of enzymes to process the excretion of bile.
<h3>Cholestasis</h3>: This interrupts the flow of bile from the liver. The bile containing conjugated bilirubin remains in the liver instead of being excreted.
<h3>Rarer conditions that may cause jaundice include</h2>:

<h3>Crigler-Najjar syndrome</h3>: This is an inherited condition that impairs the specific enzyme responsible for processing bilirubin.
<h3>Dubin-Johnson syndrome</h3>: This is an inherited form of chronic jaundice that prevents conjugated bilirubin from being secreted from of the cells of the liver.
<h3>Pseudojaundice</h3>: This is a harmless form of jaundice. The yellowing of the skin results from an excess of beta-carotene, not from an excess of bilirubin. Pseudojaundice usually arises from eating large quantities of carrot, pumpkin, or melon.
Treatment will depend on the underlying cause.
<h2>Treatment</h2>
Jaundice treatment targets the cause rather than the jaundice symptoms.

<h3>The following treatments are used:</h3>
Anemia-induced jaundice may be treated by boosting the amount of iron in the blood by either taking iron supplements or eating more iron-rich foods. Iron supplements are available for purchase online.
Hepatitis-induced jaundice requires antiviral or steroid medications.
Doctors can treat obstruction-induced jaundice by surgically removing the obstruction.
If the jaundice has been caused by use of a medication, treatment for involves changing to an alternative medication.
<h2>Prevention</h2>
Jaundice is related to liver function.
 It is essential that people maintain the health of this vital organ by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and not consuming more than the recommended amounts of alcohol.
