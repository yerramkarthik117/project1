<h3>Ulcers</h3>
      *Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine. 
      *The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain.
<center>

<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
       :Burning stomach pain
       :Feeling of fullness, 
       :bloating or belching
       :Fatty food intolerance
       :Heartburn
       :Nausea
<h2>Causes</h2>
    Peptic ulcers occur when acid in the digestive tract eats away at the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. 
  Helicobacter pylori bacteria commonly live in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. 
  Often, the H. pylori bacterium causes no problems, but it can cause inflammation of the stomach's inner layer, producing an ulcer.
<h3>(ii)Regular use of certain pain relievers.</h3>
    Taking aspirin, as well as certain over-the-counter and prescription pain medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
   They can irritate or inflame the lining of your stomach and small intestin 

<h3>Other medications</h3>
Taking certain other medications along with NSAIDs, such as: 
steroids;anticoagulants; low-dose aspirin;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs);alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate (Actonel).
They can greatly increase the chance of developing ulcers.
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
   In addition to taking NSAIDs, you may have an increased risk of peptic ulcers if you:.
  <h3> Smoke</h3>:  Smoking may increase the risk of peptic ulcers in people who are infected with H. pylori.
  <h3>Drink alcohol</h3>:  Alcohol can irritate and erode the mucous lining of your stomach, and it increases the amount of stomach acid that's produced.
  <h3>Have untreated stress</h3>
  <h3>Eat spicy foods</h3>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<h3>Antibiotics</h3>
   The antibiotics most commonly used are amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole.
   The side effects of these antibiotics are usually mild and can include:
    feeling and being sick
    diarrhoea
    a metallic taste in your mouth

<h3>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)</h3>
  PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces, preventing further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally. 
   Side effects of these are usually mild, but can include:
  Headcahe
  diarrhoea or constipation 
  feeling sick
   tummy (abdominal) pain
   dizziness
