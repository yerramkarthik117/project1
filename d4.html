<h3>Thyroid</h3>
      *Thyroid is an endocrine gland in the neck, consisting of two lobes connected by an isthmus.
      * It is found at the front of the neck, below the Adam's apple. 
      *The thyroid gland secretes three hormones, namely the thyroid hormones (thyroxine/T4 and triiodothyronine/T3) and calcitonin. <br>
      *The thyroid hormones primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis, but they also have many other effects including on development.
      * The thyroid hormones are created from iodine and tyrosine.
<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
       :Thyroid disease encompasses several diagnoses.
       : While general categories of thyroid disease symptoms sleep changes, weight changes, bowel problems, for example can overlap, 
        :Exactly how these manifest is quite different from condition to condition. 
       :In fact, symptoms of the two most common types of thyroid disease, are often opposite, though they affect the same body system.
<h2>Causes</h2>
<h3>(i)Thyroid gland</h3>
  Thyroid diseases sometimes result from inappropriate TSH levels, or may be caused by problems in the thyroid gland itself.<center>

<h3>(ii)HypoThyroidism</h3>
   The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition where the body makes antibodies that destroy parts of the thyroid gland.
   Surgical removal and certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium) can also cause hypothyroidism.<br>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
    Sanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid.
    Typhoid does not affect animals other than humans. 
    Typhoid can only spread in environments where human feces are able to contact with food or water.
<h3>(i)No to smoke</h3>
   Stop Smoking
   Cigarette smoke has a variety of toxins that may affect your thyroid. 
<h3>Ease Up On Soy</h3>
    Soy is a controversial ingredient, especially when it comes to your thyroid health. 
    Consuming soy in moderation is probably best for your overall health.
<h3>Carrying Potassium Iodide if Possible</h3>
   You may want to buy some potassium iodide (KI) to keep in your family emergency kit. 

<h2> Treatment</h2>
<h3>(i)Thyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy</h3>
   The usual treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
    With this treatment, synthetic thyroid hormone (e.g., levothyroxine*) is taken by mouth to replace the missing thyroid hormone.
    Treatment is usually life-long.


<h3>(ii)AntiThyroid medications</h3>
    Anti-thyroid medications (e.g., propylthiouracil* or methimazole) can bring hyperthyroidism under control within 6 weeks to 3 months. 
     These medications cause a decrease in the production of new thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.
 
<h3>Iodine usage</h3>
    Larger doses of regular iodine, which does not destroy the thyroid gland, help block the release of thyroid hormones. 
    It is used for the emergency treatment of thyroid storm, and to reduce the excess production of thyroid hormones before surgery.

<h3>Proper diet</h3>
