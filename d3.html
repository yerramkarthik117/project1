<h2>Psoriasis</h2>
   *Psoriasis is a common, chronic, autoimmune disease that causes dry, red, scaly patches and flakes to appear on the skin. 
   *The rash often goes away for a while, but then it flares up again, often as a result of a trigger, such as stress.
<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
   >Skins cells shed all the time, but in psoriasis, both dead and live cells collect on the skin's surface, because the replacement process is so fast. 

<h3> The main symptoms of psoriasis are:</h3>

red, flaky, crusty patches, covered with silvery scales that shed easily
intense itching and burning
However, symptoms can differ, according to the type. Severity can range from mild to severe.

According to the National Psoriasis Foundation:

  .mild psoriasis covers less than 3 percent of the body
  .moderate psoriasis affects between 3 and 10 percent
  .severe psoriasis covers over 10 percent of the body.

>Around 80 percent of people have mild psoriasis, and the other 20 percent have moderate to severe psoriasis.
<h2>Types</h2>
There are several forms of psoriasis.

<h3>Plaque psoriasis</h3>
 >About 80 to 90 percent of people with psoriasis have plaque psoriasis. 
 >It appears as raised, inflamed, red lesions, covered by a silvery, white scales, usually on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.

<h3>Inverse psoriasis</h3>
>Irritation from rubbing and sweating can make it worse, because of its location in skin folds and tender areas.
> It is more common in people who are overweight and in those with deep skin folds.
> It can affect the genital area.
<h3>Erythrodermic psoriasis</h3>
 >Erythrodermic psoriasis is a particularly inflammatory form that can affect large parts of the body surface with a fiery redness. 
 >Erythema means reddening.
<h2>Causes</h2>
*Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. It happens when a problem occurs with the immune system.


> The immune system involves a type of cells known as T cells. 
> A trigger causes the T cells to behave as if they are fighting an infection or healing a wound.
> They produce chemicals that cause inflammation.

*In psoriasis, this leads to an excessive growth of skin cells and inflammation.

Normally, skin cells take about 21 to 28 days to replace themselves, but, in patients with psoriasis, they take around 2 to 6 days.
<h2>Risk factors:/h2>
Some factors increase the likelihood of developing psoriasis.

<h3>These include</h3>:

. having cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome
. trauma to the skin
. family history

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
A person who has a persistent rash that does not go away with over-the-counter (OTC) treatment should consider asking a doctor about it.

The doctor will look at the symptoms and ask about personal and family history, and they may carry out a skin biopsy.

There are no blood tests for psoriasis.
<h2>Treatment:</h2>
: If a diagnosis is confirmed, treatment will depend on the type and severity of the condition.
: The main options include topical therapy, systemic therapy, and phototherapy.

<h3>Topical treatment:</h3>
>Topical treatment is applied directly to the skin.
> It is usually the first line of treatment, and the aim is to slow down the growth of skin cells and reduce inflammation. 
>These treatments are available over the counter (OTC) or on prescription, and include non-steroids and steroids.
<h3>Systemic therapies:</h3>
>Systemic therapies work through the body system.
> Some affect the whole system, and they are used for people with moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
> These are taken by mouth or by injection, and they include acitretin, cyclosporine, and methotrexate.
<h3>Phototherapy:</h3>
 Phototherapy is light therapy.
 The skin is exposed regularly to ultraviolet light, either in the doctor's office or at home.
 This is done under medical supervision. 
Tanning beds are not recommended as a substitute.
<h3>Home remedies</h3>
Tips include:
  .lowering stress by doing yoga, exercise, meditation or both
  .getting a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight
  .recognizing and avoiding food triggers
  .joining a support group or blog to talk with others with a similar experience
