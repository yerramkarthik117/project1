<h3>Flu</h3>
      *Influenza, or flu, is a respiratory illness caused by a virus. 
      *Flu is highly contagious and is normally spread by the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.

  Other few symptoms:-
  : high temperature
  :cold sweats and shivers
  :headache
  :ching joints and limbs
  :fatigue, feeling exhausted
       
<h2>Treatment</h2>
    A virus causes flu, so antibiotics cannot help, unless the flu has led to another illness caused by bacteria.
<h3>(ii)Antivirals</h3>
    A doctor may prescribe antivirals, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), in some circumstances.
   People can receive this treatment if they:
     are aged 12 years or over
     have had symptoms for fewer than 48 hours
<h3>Pain relief medication</h3>
   Pain relievers can alleviate some of the symptoms, such as a headache and body pains.
   Various painkillers are available to purchase online. 
   It is important to compare different products, and only take them under the advice of a medical professional.
   Some painkillers, such as aspirin, are not suitable for children under 12 years of age.

  >keep warm and rest
  >consume plenty of liquids
  >avoid alcohol
  >stop smoking
